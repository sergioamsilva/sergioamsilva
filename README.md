### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**sergioamsilva/sergioamsilva** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

I consider that my main strengths are resilience, organization and the ability to solve complex problems, I do not like computers, but I believe that somewhere in the future mankind will have the need for overcome machines. Hacking will be the answer, skynet is close. 

I believe that defeating machines is a challenge and that kind of challenge motivates me.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about PHP, CAKEPHP, PYTHON, MYSQL, LINUX
